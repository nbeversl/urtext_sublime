# Urtext Sublime Installer

UrtextSublime is now in its own package control channel and this package is an installer only. It runs automatically these steps:

- Adds to Sublime Text the package control channel https://nbeversl.github.io/urtext-channel/channel.json
- Installs the current version of the package, [UrtextSublime](https://github.com/nbeversl/UrtextSublime)
- Uninstalls itself (this installer).

You can then receive updates to UrtextSublime from its own channel.

You may instead run these steps manually if you prefer.

**Installing this package will run the above steps immediately, without any confirmation dialog.**
