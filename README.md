# Urtext Sublime Installer

UrtextSublime is now in its own package control channel and this package is an installer only. It runs automatically the steps described at https://urtext.co/setup/sublime-text/:

- Adds to Sublime Text the package control channel https://nbeversl.github.io/urtext-channel/channel.json
- Installs the current version of the package, “UrtextSublime“
- Uninstalls itself (this installer).
- You may then receive updates to UrtextSublime from its own package control channel.

You may instead run these steps manually if you prefer.

**Note** : Installing this package will run the above steps immediately, without any confirmation dialog.
