# Urtext Sublime Installer


UrtextSublime is now in its [own package control channel](https://nbeversl.github.io/urtext-channel/channel.json) and this package is an installer only. **Installing this package will run the following steps immediately, without any confirmation dialog.**

- Adds to Sublime Text the [Urtext package control channel](https://nbeversl.github.io/urtext-channel/channel.json)
- Installs the current version of the package, [UrtextSublime](https://github.com/nbeversl/UrtextSublime)
- Uninstalls itself (this installer).

You can then receive updates to UrtextSublime from its own channel.

You may instead run these steps manually if you prefer.
